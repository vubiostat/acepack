Description: Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are provided.
  The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE), 
  is an algorithm to find the fixed point of maximal
  correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2
  using smoothing functions, <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>.
  Also included is the Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than ACE when
  correlation is low, <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>.
